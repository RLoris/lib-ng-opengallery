# Ng-Opengallery

Opengallery is an Angular library component for efficient gallery rendering and interactions (images & videos). The gallery layout is responsive for all devices and loads the content only if it's in the viewport. A media viewer is shipped and included with this library. You can configure the component the way you want. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.

# NPM

You can integrate opengallery in your project using `npm i ng-opengallery --save`. For more documentation about opengallery check out the readme in the projects/opengallery folder or directly on the npm opengallery page https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-opengallery.
